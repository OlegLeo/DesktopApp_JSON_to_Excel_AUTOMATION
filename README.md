# DesktopApp_JSON_to_Excel_AUTOMATION

Developed in C# with WPF Framework - Automation Processes that fills the Excel File from JSON API.

This was one of the projects that was part of my internship.

Despite not being finished, I learned the basics of a C# language.

This project will be for a real client, which I was very sorry for not being able to finish because of the end date of the internship. Even so, I thought it was an experience that greatly enriched my knowledge.

The main objective of this project was to use a Microsoft Server database to create an API in JSON to feed the Desktop APP which, in an automated process, would fill in the excel cells.

The application has an interface that at first starts with an authentication and then shows the list of courses that exist, with the possibility of searching with a filter bar.

When clicking on a course name/item, it will ask where the user wants to save the document. This software that I was able to develop is capable of automating the entire process, to avoid having a person fill in each cell with data manually, which saves companies a lot of time.

To develop this application, I used the C# WPF Framework, which on the one hand seems to be something much less user-friendly compared to Android Studio.

I really enjoyed developing this project, since it was practically everything new that I picked up. I hope the team takes this unfinished project and ends up using the base structure I developed.
